/* The Zen Garden default was the first I put together, and almost didn't make the cut. I briefly flirted with using
    'Salmon Cream Cheese' as the main style for the Garden, but switched back to this one before launch.

    All graphics in this design were illustrated by me in Photoshop. Google Image Search provided inspiration for
    some of the elements. I did a bit of research on Kanji to come up with the characters on the top left. Anyone who
    can read that will most likely tell you it makes no sense, but the best I could do was putting together the
    characters for 'beginning' 'complete' and 'skill' to roughly say something like 'we're breaking fresh ground.'

    It's a stretch.*/
