	str_replace('_',DIR_SEP,$class_name).'.php';

inc	free energy (php snippets to just be included for "free") may
	return information. Also includes the script that should be loaded
	as part of the preinclude
res	resources (most of these would be built automatically by bootstrap
	but are versioned here anyway to make life easier)
